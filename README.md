# AudioAmpV2
This repo contains information, design files, and documentation on the Audio Amplifier PCB I designed. This is version 2 of the original design built in 2018.

Notes:
* CAD Software: KiCAD Version 9.0
* Recommend getting a 6-pin Socket for the LM386 Audio Amplifier for easier replacement
* Resistor soldering can need to be vertically soldered (Recommend searching what this looks like since the resistors used in my design don't fit the footprints exactly)
